## Linked List Cycle
https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

```python
#first solution
def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
    seen = set()
    while head and id(head) not in seen:
        seen.add(id(head))
        head = head.next
    return head and id(head) in seen
#second solution
def hasCycle(self, head):
    fast = slow = head
    while slow and fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow is fast:
            return True
    return False
